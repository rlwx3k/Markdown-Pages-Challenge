## Invader Zim

Another one of my favorite cartoons is Invader Zim. Although it came out before I was born, I was introduced to it by my friend
and have enjoyed it ever since. Like The Owl House, Invader Zim was canceled and only got two seasons, ending on a Christmas
special. It follows the journey of an alien invader named Zim as he tries to conquer Earth by blending in with its inhabitants
and tries to learn about it as much as possible in order to fulfill his mission, along with his trusty robot named Gir. All the
while, he must put up with the self-proclaimed defender of Earth named Dib, who is one of the only ones that is aware of Zim's
true nature.

It has:
>Humor

>Intriguing episodes
>
>Great animation for an early 2000's show
>
>Received a comic book series revival, as well as a movie
