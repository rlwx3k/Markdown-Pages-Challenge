## Steven Universe

Steven Universe is a Cartoon Network show that revolved around a boy named Steven Universe, who inherited a rose quartz gemstone
from his mother that allowed him magical powers, and a group of sentient magical gemstones called the Crystal Gems, which consists
of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, along with Steven. Over the course of the series, it moves away from its more silly starting tone
to more emotional, deep stories. It also introduces more characters that either oppose or are allied with the Crystal Gems, and
you get to understand more about the show's world and why it's like that.
