## Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir

Miraculous is one of my favorite cartoons! It follows the adventures of two teenagers who reside in Paris named Marinette and Adrien, who have the ability to transform into the
superheroes Ladybug and Cat Noir. Their job is to protect Paris from the villainous Hawk Moth, who uses people's negative emotions to transform them into supervillains with the
goal of taking the source of the heroes' powers.

It has:
 - Action
 - Romance/Romantic drama
 - An intriguing plot that builds itself each season
 - Five seasons that have successfully premiered already, with a sixth season on the way
