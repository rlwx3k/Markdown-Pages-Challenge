## The Owl House

The Owl House is another great cartoon that I thoroughly enjoyed; sadly, Disney canceled it and it barely got a shortened third season. With that being said, it follows the adventures of a girl named Luz who stumbles across a portal to the Demon Realm. Instead of going back to her world, she decides to stay in the Demon Realm to learn magic from a witch named Eda, and stays with her and a demon named King at a place called the Owl House.
